				<p class="bio">Michael is the founder of EGR Software and in addition to providing consulting services he focuses on long-term R&amp;D with several initiatives moving toward realization. A primary goal has always been to combine cutting-edge technical development with the arts. This led to an early and continuing fascination with large-scale spatial audio, further leading to a solid foundation in computer graphics out of a necessity to visualize 3D spatial concepts at hand. An ongoing initiative is to create an integrated software/hardware-based middleware platform called TyphonRT, which provides a modular cross-platform runtime and SDK for rich media app and custom hardware creation.<br><br>

				Michael has more than 20 years of software development experience, extending all the way back to 1992 when he first got online at the tail end of the BBS era and started programming with C making graphics demos. With the explosion of the Internet he next turned to Web programming and with a twist of fate at his first internship the summer before attending California Polytechnic University (SLO) for a Computer Science degree was tasked with investigating Java. Professionally, Michael has worked with Java since 1996 with an emphasis on client-side development using all the major graphics APIs starting with Netscape's IFC, Java2D/Swing, OpenGL/ES, all JDK versions, including all versions of the Android OS/SDK. In 2003, TyphonRT was born and continues today.</p>
