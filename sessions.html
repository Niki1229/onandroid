					<li>"Scaling Mobile Development at Twitter"</li>
					<li>Jeremy Gordon <span>Twitter</span></li>
					<li>
						<p>Scalability of Twitter’s services is legendary. What is less obvious is the speed at which engineers at Twitter experiment and iterate over its fastest growing client: Twitter for Android. In this talk, you will learn about how Twitter iterates on its most agile mobile platform. You’ll hear the good, the bad, and the ugly of scaling mobile engineering capabilities from hiring to training to iterating fast while maintaining the quality users are accustomed to. This talk is about mobile engineering at Twitter scale.</p>

					<li>"Bluetooth SMART: Connecting Physical with Digital"</li>
					<li>Marko Gargenta<span>Twitter</span></li>
					<li>
						<p>Android has recently introduced support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) aka Bluetooth SMART. Unlike regular Bluetooth, BLE has much lower power consumption as well as lower friction in detecting and connecting to nearby devices.</p>

						<p>In this talk, you will learn how to develop a BLE application that integrates with a physical device, such as FitBit or similar. We’ll look at the API for discovering BLE devices, connecting to GATT server, and communicating to the device. By the end of this talk, you should have a good understanding of  Android API for Bluetooth SMART devices.</p>
					</li>

				<ul class="sessionblock"id="a_gargenta">
					<li>"Going Native on Android"</li>
					<li>Aleksandar (Sa&#154;a) Gargenta <span>Twitter</span></li>
					<li>
						<p>Much of the Android platform is implemented in Java, and yet that code needs to access functionality written in C/C++ and compiled to native machine code. Additionally, an application developer may want to implement portions of an app in C/C++ for performance or to incorporate existing native libraries and frameworks.</p>

						<p>Java Native Interface (JNI) is a standard Java technology for integrating Java and native code. In this session, you will learn the fundamentals of JNI and how to use it as a bridge between the native and Java-based runtimes. You will also learn how to use Android's Native Development Kit (NDK) to implement (and debug) portions of an application in native code and distribute it for use on multiple machine architectures. Let's go native!</p>

					<li>"Experimental Android UX Design Patterns"</li>
					<li>Greg Nudelman <span>DesignCaffeine, Inc.</span></li>
					<li>
						<p>Review of some exciting experimental patterns from my recent book, Android Design Patterns: Interaction Design Solutions for Developers (Wiley 2013). These are possible near-future design patterns that run slightly outside the mainstream mobile approaches.  For those willing to try out new ideas, these experimental patterns represent incredible opportunities to stand out from the 500,000 apps currently available in the Play Market, leap-frog the competition and deliver uniquely engaging mobile experiences. In this practical session I will review the patterns and invite you to use the ideas as an inspiration to thinking outside the training wheels and building your own design approaches. “Try it out and you will be the evidence” - Eckhart Tolle</p>

				<ul class="sessionblock" id="s_amarasingham">
					<li>"Tricks to Make your Game/App Look Good... With Sound"</li>
					<li>Simon Amarasingham <span>dSonic</span></li>
					<li>
						<p>Did you know that the sound in a game or app can affect the way the whole is perceived? Users don't think of audio quality as separate from art quality, gameplay or usability, they perceive the completed whole. So music and sound can affect the whole product. This talk will give you some practical advice on how to maximize the quality of your game using the audio, regardless of who is creating the sound and music for you. Plus there will be some fun stuff about how the brain works, which, if you extrapolate, will lead to the formula for global mind control. To a degree. Perhaps a little. Well...you be the judge.</p>

			<ul class="sessionblock" id="d_laverde">
				<li>"Android and things (like wearables)"</li>
				<li>Dario Laverde <span>HTC</span></li>
				<li>
					<p>Sensors abound as we enter the age of the "Internet of things" and "Wearable Technologies". The glue connecting to these sensors and devices are technologies such as BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), IR and others. These allow Android powered devices (including Google Glass) to act as a hub connecting to devices, sensors and the "cloud".  Best practices, demos and code walk throughs on the available APIs featuring the new BLE API in Android 4.3 will be presented.</p>

			<ul class="sessionblock" id="s_haider">
				<li>"Building Vine for Android"</li>
				<li>Sara Haider <span>Twitter</span></li>
				<li>
					<p>This talk will cover the inspiration behind Vine and the development of Vine for Android. After Vine's success on iOS, Sara's team has tackled video editing on Android's highly fragmented platform. Sara will discuss various decisions and trade-offs that were made in building Vine's looping playback, stop-motion recorder, and overall app performance on Android. She will also provide insight into the build stack, tools, and processes used in the project.</p>

			<ul class="sessionblock" id="b_meike">
				<li>"Enterprise Android"</li>
				<li>G. Blake Meike <span>Twitter</span></li>
				<li>
					<p>When the first iPhones introduced the smart-phone era, nearly seven years ago, developers who were quick and clever made quite a bit of money writing apps for the new platform. Most of those apps were games. As the era has come of age, a lot has changed. Android passed iOS as the most common smartphone platform in the US in 2010 and the most popular platform in the world in 2012.  Coming up with a new killer game is getting harder.  In addition, it has always been harder to sell games to Android users.  The next generation of smart, agile developers is not going to be selling stand-alone games: They will be writing apps that are mobile, connected and ubiquitous.  The tracking device used by the guy that delivers packages to your doorstep, your car, and perhaps, even your smart house, may well run Android. To catch the wave, you'll need to be able to write apps that are networked, secure and reliable.</p>

				<li>"OpenCL: An Introduction To Cross-Platform Computation"</li>
				<li>Michael Leahy <span>EGR Software</span></li>
				<li>
					<p>OpenCL is a standardized cross-platform API for using low-level hardware for computation tasks. This includes using the GPU of desktop and mobile platforms, but may also include more bespoke computation on general DSP components and FPGAs in the future. This class provides a survey of the current state of the art of using OpenCL on Android to enable computation on the GPU for graphics and general algorithm execution. There are many benefits to offloading computation from the CPU of mobile devices from faster processing to conserving battery life. The largest reason to consider OpenCL is for cross-platform compatibility such that algorithms developed can be deployed to mobile and desktop platforms without specifically targeting compute-based APIs on any particular platform such as Google's Renderscript.</p>

					<p>As OpenGL ES 3.0 and further advancements from NVIDIA (Tegra 5) and other GPU vendors enable full OpenGL 4.x API compatibility on mobile platforms, there will be increased options for OpenCL and OpenGL integration, including compute shaders, which are currently only available in the full desktop profile of OpenGL. Such capabilities are future-oriented, but a timely discussion covering enhanced possibilities that are expected in 2014/15 will be covered.</p>

					<p>This presentation will cover how to most efficiently solve a large, but finite 2D grid walk traversal problem detailing the steps required to implement a solution with parallelism utilizing multi-threading on the CPU and / or the GPU when OpenCL is available. Several visualizations will be presented that clearly show different algorithm implementations. Demo code for Java,  Android, and the desktop along with all media files will be available on GitHub (https://github.com/egrsoftware/gridwalk). You will take away up-to-the-moment information on which Android devices support OpenCL and have a deeper understanding of how to solve algorithms in the fastest manner possible and lowest memory usage such that they can run efficiently on Android and the desktop.</p>

				<li>"The Four Mobile Traps: How To Avoid the Most Common Mistakes Plaguing Mobile Apps and Websites"</li>
				<li>Mike Mace <span>UserTesting.com</span></li>
				<li class="points">
					<p>Today, developers have the daunting challenge of effectively reaching their audiences on all three screens: desktop, mobile, and tablet. But the transition to mobile is an even bigger challenge than most companies realize. It changes the rules of good development, makes users reconsider their default choices in apps and websites, and increases the importance of user engagement.</p>

					<p>After conducting thousands of mobile user tests, we have uncovered four common traps that companies fall victim to when transitioning their websites and apps to mobile:<p>

					<ul>
						<li>Trap #1: “Porting” to Mobile</li>
						<li>Trap #2: Unclear Controls</li>
						<li>Trap #3: Not Reassuring Privacy</li>
						<li>Trap #4: Failure to Engage the User</li>
					</ul>

					<p>In this presentation, Mobile Strategist Michael Mace will reveal these traps as well as provide attendees with useful Android-specific tips and case studies on how to avoid them. Mobile isn’t just a different set of technologies; it’s a different set of user behaviors and expectations. By avoiding these four mobile traps, you can set your company apart and gain a competitive advantage over the upcoming years.</p>
